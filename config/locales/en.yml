       text: Hi all! My name is Maksym! I'm a Beginner Ruby on Rails Developer! 
             In this tutorial project, thanks to my efforts, 
             polymorphic relationships between entities were implemented! 
             The project is implemented on Ruby 3.2 and Rails 7.0.4 
             I used gems like "devise" "i18n" "rubyzip" "enum" "pagy" The project is not fully implemented! 
             This is my first step! Thank you!!!!!
